# 30 day map challenge - 2021

The map challenge is a daily mapping/cartography/data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community. The idea is to create (and publish) maps based on different themes on each day of the month. There are no restrictions on the tools, technologies or the data you use in your maps.
